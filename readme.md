# The Weather Application
- Type of Challenge: Conslidation

### Mission objectives 

In this challenge I will use and consolidate my knowledge on:

- A typical HTTP flow: send asynchronous requests to a remote server and process the results
- DOM manipulation: changing the DOM based on the results of the HTTP requests
- Learn to aggregate and parse data fetched from an api

### The Mission

I have been sent abroad for a 10-month work mission. My family and friends back home ask me about the weather where I live ALL. THE. TIME.
Enough is enough, I decide to build a small web application for them so that I can free my time to talk about more interesting topics.
